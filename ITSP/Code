The nodes will be detected and stored in a list and they will be structures
with the Co-ordinates a flag to mark the type of the node and a list containing
the indices of the nodes they are directly attached to.
The nodes can be
1. left or right turn
2. A T shaped junction
3. A plus shaped junction

After mapping the mae will be stored as an array of structures(for representing
the nodes).

For finding the shortest path a bredth wise exploration of the map will be made
either from the starting or the final node(may also include non-node points)
    It will be taken care that there is no looping the search
        for that a list of explored indices has to be stored
    It has to be taken care that the bredth wise exploration takes care of the
    length of the path covered and not just the no. of nodes for that the path
    covered should also be stored or taken care of

For moving the maze
    1. first angle correction through vision
    2. offset correction through vision
    3. any motion has to account for the offset between the center of the image
        and the center of the two wheels

Lower level:
    1. Vision:
        funcyion to detect the nodes and return the orientation and postion in
        the image

    2. angular motion from the motors
    3. lateral displacement from the motors
