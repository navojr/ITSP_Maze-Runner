1st review meet at around 9th or 10th

use github, gitter

documentation, bills, completion of project FOR REIMBERSEMENT

etcher
follow steps from the raspberry site to install the necessary software
go and change the keyboard settings mouse and keyboard sett. keyboard layout.
softwares similar to that of ubuntu
through ssh we can go into that rasp and do all the work

vnc helps to show the screen of r-py through net

HOW TO CONNECT THE RPY TO WIFI WITHOUT BOOTING
all the the passwords are stored
go to tutorials stab rasp and go to the configuration section and the wifi

enable ssh

raspberry.local
in case static IP has to be placed then some more files has to be changed
can use putty as the terminal for windows and mac
eg
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local here the it is username@hostname
there a green light blinks if it gets booted correctly
we should install real VNC on pc

GPIO
the digital and the analog in and out ping for the gpio.
there a python module to use the gpio called py.gpio
sudo install pythonrpy.gpio see the gpio section the tutorials in the stab website

eg 
Import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) the broadcom processor it is the standard and the method s the board nomeclature for naming the pins
GPIO.setup(4, GPIO.OUT)

blue = 2
green = 3
red = 4

GPIO.setup(blue, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(blue, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(blue, GPIO.OUT)

try:
    while True:
            GPIO.ouput(4, GPIO.HIGH)
            time.sleep(1)
            GPIO.output(4, GPOI.LOW)
            time.sleep(1)
except keyboardInterrupt:
        GPIO.cleanup() ;makes all the pins low

can use simple http server
sudo apt install python-simpleHTTPserver
nano indent.html ;nanno is a text editor
SimpleHTTPserver 80 here 80 is some port no.
we can make a webpage having the controls and serving of the camera
can use flask or jango
cd /etc/
nano .ssh for starting the program automatically on ssh
add 
python /home/pi/Desktop/gpio.py

there will be a tutorial to install the opencv in rpy.
